			<h2>Why?</h2>
			<p>
				My wife wanted an informal gift registry that wasn't tied to a particular outlet.  All the options that she found were lame in some way.
			</p>
			<h2>How</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Click the big button above to create a new list</li>
				<li>Type in a name for your list</li>
				<li>Add your list items</li>
				<li>Add more checkboxes to the items (in case you want six pairs of socks or something, so that different people can check as many of the checkboxes as they bought)</li>
				<li>If you want, you can edit the items to add a link to an online listing of the item you have in mind</li>
				<li>Copy the "share" link to send to your friends</li>
				<li>Bookmark the current page so that you can get back to the list and be able to edit it later if you need to</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Example of creating a list</h2>

			<h2>Example of somebody getting linked to a list</h2>
			<img src="images/editing-a-list.gif" alt="An animated gif showing what it looks like when other people edit your list" class="gif-screenshot">
			<h2>Anything else?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Anyone with the long URL can edit everything about the list</li>
				<li>The checkboxes aren't permission controlled - they are associated with the name that people typed in, but that's only there to help people remember what they checked before - if you type in someone else's name, you'll be able to uncheck whatever they checked</li>
				<li>If you have any questions, want to run the server yourself, or want to discuss a feature, <a href="https://github.com/TehShrike/communal-checklist">check out the project on Github</a> - the whole thing's open source</li>
