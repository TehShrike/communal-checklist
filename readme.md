All the gift registry apps my wife tried out looked pretty horrible, so I made this one.

## To do

- UI that encourages people to put in their name immediately after visiting a registry
- optimistic concurrency control
- broadcast all change/save events to the list's room
- "share" link for owners
- store edit keys in localstorage?
- allow owners to uncheck people's checks?
- deploy
