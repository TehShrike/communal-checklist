All the gift registry apps my wife tried out looked pretty horrible, so I made this one.

## To run it yourself

You'll need [node](https://iojs.org/) installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TehShrike/communal-checklist.git
cd communal-checklist
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
``

## To do

- store edit keys in localstorage?
- allow owners to uncheck other people's checks?
- deploy
